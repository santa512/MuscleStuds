				Like most web sites, MuscleBoy Wrestling uses cookies.<br/><br/>
				A cookie is a small file placed on your computer to help us provide you with a good online experience. It's how we distinguish you from other people that visit muscleboywrestling.com. Pretty much every site nowadays uses them for such basic necessities as "user sessions" (i.e. knowing and remembering if you are logged in or not).<br/><br/>

				How MuscleBoy Wrestling uses cookies<br/><br/>

				There are two types of cookies that we use:<br/>

				Cookies that remember your preferences<br/>

				We use standard 'session identification' cookies created by our web system, based on Yii Framework. These cookies are used to distinguish you from other users.<br/>

				For example, if you're a registered user, a cookie helps us keep you logged in to the site and makes sure that you have access to the member's area content as you navigate from page to page. In other instances, cookies help us avoid the need for us to ask you the same question over and over again (like will you accept cookies). We just save your answer instead of asking again and again and again.<br/>

				We also use the Facebook Like and Send Buttons and, Twitter Tweet Button and, Google+ Button which allows users to quickly share pages via various social media sites. The cookie records if you've shared info on this site before and saves your preferences.<br/>

				Cookies that help us understand how our site is used<br/><br/>

				Muscleboy Wrestling uses Google Analytics to measure and analyze what people do on our site. This is the gold standard of online analytics tools and we use it to look at things like which pages are most popular (and which ones aren't), which browsers people use, how they arrive at our site, etc. - all of which allows us to keep improving the site and your experience.<br/>

				These are all standard uses of cookies and we do not record any more information than needed or do anything out of the norm. If you wish to restrict, block or delete cookies, you can do this through your web browser. Instructions for how to manage cookies for all versions of all of the major web browsers - Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera et al. can be found online with a standard search.<br/>

				If you've got any questions about the way we use cookies, don't hesitate to contact us for more information.<br/>
